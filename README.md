# <Random_Password_Generator>

## Description

For this project, I have created majority of javascript code from a template. The template included the HTML and CSS files, as well as the connecting code for the .js file. I undertook this talk to improve my understanding of basic JavaScript and its components. I solved issues and utilized the following:
- utilizing functions, arrays, variables, boolean, for-loops, and more
- troubleshooting with browser console
- creating dependant and nested variables and functions
- utilizing scope to prevent errors
